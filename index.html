          <p class="computing-machines">
            Computing machines invented on this generation are entirely mechanical. Early mechanical tools to help
            <br />humans with digital calculations, like the abacus, were called &#34;calculating machines&#34;, called
            by <br />proprietary names, or referred to as calculators. The machine operator was called the computer.
          </p>
          <p class="ABACUS-probably-of">
            ABACUS - Probably of babylionan origin, an abacus is an calculating instrument that uses beads that slides
            along the series of wires or rods set in a frame to represent that decimal places. It is the ancestor of the
            modern digital calculator. used by merchants in the middle ages throughout europe and the arabic world, it
            was gradually replaced by arithmetic based on Hindu-arabic-numerals.though rarely used in Europe past the
            18th century, it is stiill used in the middle east,china, and Japan.<br /><br /><br />PASCALINE - also
            called arithmetic machine, the first calculator or adding machine to be produced in any quantity and
            actually used. the Pascaline was designed and built by the french mathematician-philosopher blaise pascal
            between 1642 and 1644. it could only do addition and subtracion, with the numbers being entered b
            manipulating its dials.pascal invented the machine for his father, a tax collector, so it was the first
            business machine too (if one does not count the abacus). He built 50 of them over the next 10 years.<br /><br />STEPPED
            RECKONER - could add,subtract , multiply, divide , and evaluate square roots first to attempt to create a
            machine that could be used not only for addition and subtraction but would utilize a moveable carriage to
            enable long multiplication and division.<br /><br />DIFFERENCE ENGINE - It is an early calculating machine,
            verging on being the first computer, designed and partially built during the 1820’s and ‘30s by charles
            babbage. babbage was an english mathematician and inventor: he invented the cowcatcher, reformed the british
            portal system and was a pioneer in the fields f operation research that the weather of years past could be
            read from tree rings. He also had a lifelong fascination with keys, ciphers and mechanical dolls
            (automatons).<br /><br />DIFFERENCE ENGINE - generally considered the first computer, designed and partly
            built by the English invertor Charles Babbage in the 19th century (he worked in until his death in 1871)
            while working on the difference engine, a simple calculating machine commissioned by the british government,
            babbage began to imagine ways to improve it, Chiefly he thought about generalizing its operation so that it
            could perform other kinds of calculations. by the time funding ran out so that it could perform other kinds
            of calculations. by the time funding ran out for his difference engine in 1833, he had concieved of
            something far more revolutionary: a general- purpose computing machine called the analytical engine.

        <div class="identity-theft-is-wrapper">
          <p class="identity-theft-is">
            Identity Theft - is the most common cybercrime today <br />and is done by a perpetrator to commit fraud for
            financial gains <br />through fake credentials and by purporting to be someone else. <br />Sources of
            identity information come from the breach of government <br />or federal records, including private sites
            which contain important <br />and even sensitive information such as credit information, home <br />address,
            and email, among others. To prevent identity theft, be careful <br />not to post your personal information
            on the internet, especially on <br />social media. Provide only the necessary information in legitimate
            <br />online transactions.<br /><br />Hacking - Hacking has become more sophisticated over the years;
            <br />it has broken into numerous sites, affected government websites, <br />businesses and private
            computers—leading to disastrous effects. <br />Hackers use computer systems to gain access to business trade
            <br />secrets and personal information for malicious and exploitive <br />purposes. The perpetrator uses a
            variety of software to do this, <br />allowing him to take personal and important information while the
            <br />owner may be unaware that his files are being accessed from a <br />remote location. Hackers are
            extremely difficult to identify on both <br />an individual and group level due to their various security
            measures—such as the use of <br />proxies and anonymity networks, which distort and protect their
            identity.<br /><br /> Theft - Another common cybercrime which some internet users are <br />not even aware
            of is piracy. Have you ever downloaded software, <br />games, music or movies from questionable sites or
            using shady <br />means? Illegal downloading is a cybercrime, as downloading <br />pirated content violates
            copyright laws. Sites that encourage <br />software piracy are constantly being monitored and targeted by
            <br />relevant authorities, as law-making bodies investigate this <br />cybercrime in order to address it.
            <br />o Search Software Piracy in the Philippines. <br /><br />
            Cyber Bullying and Stalking - Cyber Bullying is a kind of online <br />harassment which involves the barrage
            of messages, emails and <br />other forms of online communication, sometimes with the <br />perpetrator
            using a hidden or fake online identity. In this case, the <br />goal may be the defamation of a victim on a
            public or private <br />media outlet due to contempt or out of entertainment. <br />Perpetrators also use
            the internet to stalk potential victims—and <br />combine these with offline stalking and blackmail for a
            personal <br />gain.<br /><br />Scammers and Phishers - are confidence artists that attempt to defraud a
            person <br />or group after first gaining their confidence through an online outlet like social media.
            <br />Personal ads, dating ads, even discount promotions received through emails are some <br />creative
            schemes employed by these perpetrators. Phishers obtain important information <br />from victims by sending
            e-mails or messages by posing as legitimate organizations or <br />institutions, such as your bank. Replying
            or clicking through certain links usually redirect <br />the target to fake sites that ask for personal
            information or credentials. Such sites can tarnish <br />the company’s reputation and brand, which could
            potentially lead to a decrease in earnings.

            Computing are any goal- oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating computers. Computer is
            programmable device that stores, retrieves, and processes data. The major changes made on computer are
            from an early mechanical calculator that revolutionized computation with its groundbreaking invention and
            changes to a device usually consisting of a sealed glass or metal-ceramic enclosure that is used in
            electronic circuitry to control a flow of electrons. And that lead to smaller, more reliable and energy
            efficient computers. And changes to a revolution miniaturization, enabling smaller, more powerful, and
            reliable computing devices. It significantly change to enchanced mobile communication by enabling faster
            data and pave way for numerous services and it lead to present artificial intelligence machines to adapt,
            significantly altering our interactions with technology. In Biology the ways computers are used in life
